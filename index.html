      <p> I’m a non-traditional, distance student from Washington, DC. Prior to college, I worked for an international audience in non-profits and policy overseas during my pre-university gap years. Now I study remotely to remain traveling.</p>
      <p>While studying online allows me to stay mobile, I also couple my academic coursework with internships and research projects. Refining ubiquitous software and programming tools in technology, then, provides the flexibility to explore application in different industries. I’ve worked in both the public and private sector in areas such as policy, healthcare, education, design, customer service, and entertainment and plan to continue experimenting in college. </p>
      <p> My primary objective is to have fun building necessary design, technical, research, and soft skills before graduation. </p>
